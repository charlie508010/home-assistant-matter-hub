### Legend

- ✅ = Confirmed working
- ⚠️ = Partial support or known issues
- ❓ = Untested or unknown
- ❌ = Not supported by the controller

\* Alexa vacuum support requires the `vacuumOnOff` feature flag enabled.

\*\* Alexa does not support the standalone ModeSelect device type (0x0027). The ModeSelect cluster is only recognized on specific device types like Lamp or Fan. See [Alexa Supported Device Categories](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/supported-matter-device-categories.html) and [#273](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/273).

## Controller Profiles

HAMH includes built-in controller profiles that pre-configure feature flags for optimal compatibility:

| Profile | Key Settings |
|---|---|
| **Apple Home** | `autoForceSync: true`, `coverUseHomeAssistantPercentage: true` |
| **Google Home** | `autoForceSync: true` |
| **Alexa** | `autoForceSync: true`, `vacuumOnOff: true` |
| **Multi-Controller** | `autoForceSync: true`, `vacuumOnOff: true`, `coverUseHomeAssistantPercentage: true` |

See [Bridge Configuration](../getting-started/bridge-configuration.md) for details on how to select a profile.
