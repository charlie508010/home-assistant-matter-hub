# Bulk Delete Alexa Smart Home Devices

If you have many old or duplicate smart home devices in Alexa — for example after migrating from HAASKA or after
reconfiguring your bridge — deleting them one by one through the Alexa app can be tedious. This guide describes a
faster method using the Amazon web interface and the browser developer console.

:::warning
This deletes **all** smart home devices from your Alexa account, not just those from Home Assistant Matter Hub.
After deletion, run "Alexa, discover devices" to re-add devices from your active skills and bridges.

## Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- You must be logged in to your Amazon account

## Steps

### 1. Find your regional Alexa API endpoint

Open one of the following URLs in your browser and check which one returns a JSON list of your devices:

| Region | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Germany | `https://alexa.amazon.de/api/behaviors/entities?skillId=amzn1.ask.1p.smarthome` |
| US | `https://alexa.amazon.com/api/behaviors/entities?skillId=amzn1.ask.1p.smarthome` |
| US (alt) | `https://layla.amazon.com/api/behaviors/entities?skillId=amzn1.ask.1p.smarthome` |
| US (alt 2) | `https://pitangui.amazon.com/api/behaviors/entities?skillId=amzn1.ask.1p.smarthome` |
| Japan | `https://alexa.amazon.co.jp/api/behaviors/entities?skillId=amzn1.ask.1p.smarthome` |

You should see a JSON response containing your devices. If you get an error, try a different URL or make sure you are
logged in.

### 2. Open the developer console

On the same page where you got the JSON response, open the browser developer console:

- **Chrome / Edge**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+J` (macOS)
- **Firefox**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+K` (macOS)

### 3. Run the deletion script

Paste the following script into the console and press Enter:

```js
devices = await (await fetch('/nexus/v1/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `query {
      endpoints {
        items {
          friendlyName
          legacyAppliance { applianceId }
        }
      }
    }`
  })
})).json();

for (const device of devices.data.endpoints.items) {
  const res = await fetch(
    `/api/phoenix/appliance/${encodeURIComponent(device.legacyAppliance.applianceId)}`,
    {
      method: "DELETE",
      headers: {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
    }
  );
  console.log(device.friendlyName, res.status);
}
```

The console will log each device name and the HTTP status code (`200` = success).

### 4. Refresh and rediscover

1. Refresh the page — the device list should now be empty.
   If devices still remain, you may have a CSRF issue; try logging out and back in, then repeat from step 1.
2. Say **"Alexa, discover devices"** to re-add devices from your active skills and Matter bridges.
3. Refresh the page again to confirm only your current devices are listed.
